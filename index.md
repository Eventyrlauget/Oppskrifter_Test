### **DESCRIPTION**

Fried tempeh goreng! Delicious pieces of crunchy tempeh with a layer of ketjap manis. Low FODMAP, gluten-free, lactose-free and vegan.



SCALE**1X2X3X**

### INGREDIENTS

* 750 g tempeh
* 600 ml sunflower oil
* 3–6 tsp sambal (use 3 tsp if you don’t like spicy food)
* 12 tbsp ketjap manis (sweet soy sauce)
* 3 tsp fresh ginger, grated
* 3 tsp sugar (in original recipes gula java or coconut blossom sugar is used but because this has not been tested on FODMAPs yet and because I didn’t have it, I used normal sugar)
* A pinch of salt (x3)



### **INSTRUCTIONS**

1. Cut the tempeh into thin slices of about 0.5 cm thick.
2. Heat the oil in a heat-proof pan.
3. If you think the oil is hot enough to deep-fry, you can put a piece of tempeh in the oil. If the oil starts to sizzle and bubble it is hot enough.
4. Fry the tempeh in parts until they are brown and crunchy. For me, this took about 3-4 minutes for each batch.
5. Scoop the tempeh out of the oil with a heat-proof spatula and leave to drain on some paper.
6. Heat a tablespoon of oil in another pan. Cut the ginger into very small pieces. Put the ginger, sugar, ketjap, sambal and salt into the pan and then add the tempeh.
7. Fry for a few minutes while you stir regularly. The ketjap will become very sticky and will from a glossy layer around the pieces of tempeh.
8. Scoop the tempeh out of the pan and serve immediately. The tempeh is very nice with rice on the side, but also with veggies.
